Image-Analyser
==============
A small class file which simplifies image analysis in processing scripts.
Feel free to add functions or make the existing ones more performant.

Features
==============
- easy looping trough pixels
- calculate the average color value around a given pixel
- manipulate pixels/colors with [x,y] instead of [ofsset]
- automatically restrain the surface being analysed to the image surface
- easily manage color transparency

Usage
==============
There's some sample code which demonstrates the script, and I think that's all you need.
It's pretty straight-forward and extremely-commented! ;)


Enjoy!
