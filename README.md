Image-Analyser
==============
A small class file which __simplifies__ __image analysing__ in [__Processing__](http://processing.org/) scripts.
Feel free to add functions or make the existing ones more performant. ;)

Features
==============
- __easy looping__ trough pixels
- calculate the __average color__ value around a given pixel
- manipulate pixels/colors with __[x,y]__ instead of [offset]
- automatically __restrain__ the surface being analysed to the image surface
- easily manage color __transparency__

Usage
==============
There's some sample code which demonstrates the script, and I think that's all you need.
It's pretty straight-forward and extremely-commented! ;)


Enjoy!
